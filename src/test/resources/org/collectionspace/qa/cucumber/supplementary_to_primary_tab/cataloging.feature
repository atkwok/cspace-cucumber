## The remainder of this feature file, below, needs to be converted from narrative (broad declarative steps)
## to testable steps
#
  # Scenario: Keyboard Accessibility
  #   # doesn't work, need to do later
  #   When user uses tab through the entire formula
  #   Then each of the fields should be reachable
  #   Then the two save buttons and Cancel button should be reachable
  #   Then the folding functionality should be usable # tab to it and hit space
  #   Then the focus is visible at all times
  #   Then the terms used in the right frame should be reachable
